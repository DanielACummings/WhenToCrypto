				<p>Fluctuating value relative to local currency is one of the main challenges cryptocurrency users face. It is also a significant hindrance to cryptocurrency mass adoption.</p>
				<p>If one Bitcoin is bought for $8,600 then used for a purchase the next day when the price is $8,300, purchasing power would be lost. To avoid that, the Bitcoin should not be used until its market value is at or above the original purchase price.</p>
				<p>When dealing with one crypto purchase, it is easy to know when to spend or sell without losing purchasing power. But that .becomes more difficult to calculate when tracking many transactions of a crypto purchased at varying values. A spreadsheet could be used to track transaction data and rolling averages of each crypto's value.</p>
				<p>Or you could use WhenToCrypto.</p>
