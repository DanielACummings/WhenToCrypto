				<p>One of the biggest problems facing cryptocurrency users and slowing down its adoption is its fluctuating value relative to local currency. If you bought one Bitcoin for $8,600 then made a purchase the next day when the price was $8,300, you would lose purchasing power. In order to keep that from happening, you need to wait to spend spend any of that Bitcoin until the Bitcoin market price is at or above what you paid for it.</p>
				<p>When dealing with one crypto purchase, it is easy to know when that is. But what about when you have multiple coins and tokens to track and you make multiple purchases of them all at different values? You would have to use a spreadsheet app to track all of your transaction data, set up the calculations for tracking the rolling average of each crypto's value, then store that document on the cloud for easy access.</p>
				<p>Or you could use WhenToCrypto.</p>
